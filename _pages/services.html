    <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">A short, dynamic video interview with the CEO or other senior leader can position you as a leading authority on a subject or an advocate for a case. The finished video will typically last between 30 and 60 seconds and focus on a single clear point to main- tain its simplicity and power. This will then be edited to a high level, brand- ed, cut with b-roll or stock imagery and distributed through Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and other social channels. </p>
