<p>Ashbright designs and executes communications campaigns to help organizations and leaders engage intelligently with people who matter.</p>

<h2>Viewpoint</h2>
<h3>A video interview</h3>
<p>A short, dynamic video interview with the CEO or other senior leader can position you as a leading authority on a subject or an advocate for a case. The finished video will typically last between 30 and 60 seconds and focus on a single clear point to main- tain its simplicity and power. This will then be edited to a high level, brand- ed, cut with b-roll or stock imagery and distributed through Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and other social channels.</p>

<h2>Master Highlights</h2>
<h3>A short video</h3>
<p>A lively, upbeat highlights video with carefully curated shots of your senior people mingling with clients, partners, celebrities and other guests. We would produce one 60 second highlights video for each day and a master highlights video covering the entire event.</p>

<h2>Thought Leadership</h2>
<h3>Opinion</h3>
<p>We draft and place opinion editorials that set the agenda and engage the audience with well-researched comment and analysis. Each article will be of 700 words in length addressing topical issues of the day relevant to the client's agenda. Our team has written for Heads of Government, Ministers, blue-chip CEOs and royal family members, and we have placed content in publications including Financial Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Reuters, Project Syndicate among others.</p>

<h2>The explainer</h2>
<h3>Infographics</h3>
<p>This is a handy way of summing up what you have achieved at your event, including metrics on social media engagement, visitor numbers and other key data.</p>

<h2>Live coverage</h2>
<h3>Twitter</h3>
<p>Our team of journalists will report on your event, picking up the most pertinent quotes and publish them with live images on your social media channels. We prepare some of the content in advance to ensure we connect with global audiences through relevant hashtags and promote the content through paid channels where needed.</p>


<h2>The money shot</h2>
<h3>World-class photography</h3>
<p>We work with leading international lifestyle photographers to produce arresting images that capture individual characters and the excitement of the event. These images are distributed rapidly through social media channels and published to other channels including websites and newsletters. Typically we supply 50 images per day, 10 of which are captioned and tagged for social media.</p>

<h2>The branded newsletter</h2>
<h3>An email summary</h3>
<p>We draft and distribute by email a branded daily newsletter to give your key stakeholders all the highlights and content in one place. This includes news, photos, quotes and reporting on what took place focus- ing on the key events and themes of the day.</p>
