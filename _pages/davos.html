     <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">At Davos in January 2019, we delivered a creative newsroom for Ukraine House Davos, showcasing the best of Ukraine across four days of discussion panels, celebrity interviews, cultural events and parties. The house itself saw more than 7,000 people visit over five days, but these numbers were significantly amplified through our work with live streaming video, original video production, live tweets and social media outreach. In those five days alone, we achieved 56,700 live panel viewers on Facebook, 83,800 fans across Facebook and Instagram and 110,600 page engagements. Numbers that continue to grow after the event. </p>
